# STOP!!!  READ BEFORE USE

## Condition:
If you are using my processed files, please cite my paper, the American Community Survey, the Seattle Open Data website and the Seattle City Government Website as **giving me and raw data providers appropriate credit**. I have put many hours to process the messy files. Thanks.

## Files Decoding:
- Burg = Burglary
- Hom = Homicide
- Shop = Shoplifting
- Rob = Robbery
- Auto = Autotheft
- Ass = Assault (lol)
- Har = Harrass
- Pdam = Property Damage

- Demog = Demographic files of the Seattle census tracts (% Poverty, % No High School Diploma, % White, Population Count, etc.)

## Shape Files:
KC_Tract is the census tract files for the King County, seattle is for Seattle only. Note though, I made some tiny edits to remove the three census tracts with number 200+. These areas are extremely small, and are not useful for our analysis.
