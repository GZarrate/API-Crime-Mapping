# Spatial Statistics of the Crimes in Seattle Census Tract
A R Program to do some spatial statistics :expressionless:

# Replicability Statement

*I anticipate full capability of future scholars replicating my analysis using the data and my codes*

The file I downloaded comes from the [Office of Planning & Community Development](http://www.seattle.gov/dpd/cityplanning/populationdemographics/decennialcensus/2010/default.htm), the *American Fact Finder*
[American Community Survey, 5-Year Estimate for 2010-2014](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml), and the **Seattle Police Department 911 Incident Response ** of the *Public Safety Section* of the [Seattle Open Data Center website] (https://data.seattle.gov/browse?category=Public+Safety). Based on my observations, you may make the same replication using the data from the Chicago,Houston, Atlanta and by golly OK City, Oklahoma! :happy:

**Note:** You do need to make some pre-sorting and pre-cleaning directly on the data you download from the ACS (they are very messy). After I am able to place my paper in ArXiv, I will also one of my post-sorted data, as an example for you. :broken_heart:
